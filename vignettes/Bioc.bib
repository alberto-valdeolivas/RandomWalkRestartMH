abstract = {Many real-world complex systems consist of a set of elementary units connected by relationships of different kinds. All such systems are better described in terms of multiplex networks, where the links at each layer represent a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes, rather than in terms of (single-layer) networks. In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of: i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers. The measures we introduce are validated on a genuine multiplex data set of Indonesian terrorists, where information among 78 individuals are recorded with respect to mutual trust, common operations, exchanged communications and business relationships.},

    abstract = "{Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth in the number of identified interactions between biological molecules. These interactions are usually represented as large and complex networks, calling for the development of appropriated tools to exploit the functional information they contain. Random walk with restart (RWR) is the state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach. It explores the network vicinity of gene/protein seeds to study their functions, based on the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend to lie close to each other in the networks.In this study, we extended the RWR algorithm to multiplex and heterogeneous networks. The walk can now explore different layers of physical and functional interactions between genes and proteins, such as protein–protein interactions and co-expression associations. In addition, the walk can also jump to a network containing different sets of edges and nodes, such as phenotype similarities between diseases. We devised a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to evaluate the algorithms abilities to predict disease-associated genes. We demonstrate the increased performances of the multiplex-heterogeneous RWR as compared to several random walks on monoplex or heterogeneous networks. Overall, our framework is able to leverage the different interaction sources to outperform current approaches. Finally, we applied the algorithm to predict candidate genes for the Wiedemann–Rautenstrauch syndrome, and to explore the network vicinity of the SHORT syndrome.The source code is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/RWR-MH.

@article{Li2010,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clinical diseases are characterized by distinct phenotypes. To identify disease genes is to elucidate the gene-phenotype relationships. Mutations in functionally related genes may result in similar phenotypes. It is reasonable to predict disease-causing genes by integrating phenotypic data and genomic data. Some genetic diseases are genetically or phenotypically similar. They may share the common pathogenetic mechanisms. Identifying the relationship between diseases will facilitate better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism of diseases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this article, we constructed a heterogeneous network by connecting the gene network and phenotype network using the phenotype-gene relationship information from the OMIM database. We extended the random walk with restart algorithm to the heterogeneous network. The algorithm prioritizes the genes and phenotypes simultaneously. We use leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the ability of finding the gene-phenotype relationship. Results showed improved performance than previous works. We also used the algorithm to disclose hidden disease associations that cannot be found by gene network or phenotype network alone. We identified 18 hidden disease associations, most of which were supported by literature evidence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The MATLAB code of the program is available at http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/aspatra/research/Yongjin{\_}BI2010.zip.},

Started by Dr Victor A. McKusick as the definitive reference Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/) is now distributed electronically by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, where it is integrated with the Entrez suite of databases. Derived from the biomedical literature, OMIM is written and edited at Johns Hopkins University with input from scientists and physicians around the world. Each OMIM entry has a full-text summary of a genetically determined phenotype and/or gene and has numerous links to other genetic databases such as DNA and protein sequence, PubMed references, general and locus-specific mutation databases, HUGO nomenclature, MapViewer, GeneTests, patient support groups and many others. OMIM is an easy and straightforward portal to the burgeoning information in human genetics.},
