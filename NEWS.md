## RandomWalkRestartMH v1.9.2 (Release date: 2020-09-01) 

Minor update to fix some problems with the *create.multiplexHetNetwork.topResults*
function when using weights in the bipartite network. 

## RandomWalkRestartMH v1.9.1 (Release date: 2020-08-05) 

Major update with the following main points:

* Added the possiblity to perform Random Walk with restart on full multiplex
heterogeneous networks (Both networks connected by bipartite interactions
can now be multiplex).

* RandomWalkRestartMH can now handle weighted networks. 

* New package website for the sake of clarity. 

* Minor changes in the way to create multiplex objects (A list of graphs 
is now required.)

* Replaced the references to bioRxiv by the final publication in Bioinformatics.
